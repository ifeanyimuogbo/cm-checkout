# Chimoney Shopping Cart

An Ecommerce app demo-ing an Amazon-like cart built with Create React App (Javascript -- propTypes for type safety) using dummy data (images fetched from Chimoney API to demo API fetching--- because giftcards weren't available)

## Background

- I implemented the exact same Amazon-like cart interface snapshot shown in the frontend assessment document to demonstrate excellence with frontend and my knack for impressive implementation despite the limitation a static snapshot UI presents (not an actual inspectable/interactable Figma/Sketch/... UI) ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
- I avoided the use of 'chimoney' in repository naming to avoid getting plagiarized (Notice 'cm-checkout')
- Live link: https://chimoney-cart-checkout.netlify.app ðŸš¨
- PS: If I had more time, I'd have done proper e2e tests with cypress, used proper skeleton loaders and extended the UI further to capture a full Amazon-like shopping experience.
- For some reason, the chimoney API wasn't returning giftcards. Hence, I had to use dummy-data but still demonstarted my API fetching skill by fetching the images in the featuredProducts array of the '/info/assets' endpoint.

## Technologies

- React JS
- Create React App
- Context API
- Styled Components (I avoided UI libraries as I wanted to demonstrate my dexterity and excellent skill with CSS-in-JS)
- Axios for API fetching
