# Chimoney Shopping Cart

An Ecommerce app demo-ing an Amazon-like cart built with Create React App (Javascript -- propTypes for type safety) using dummy data (images fetched from Chimoney API to demo API fetching--- because giftcards weren't available)

## Background

- I IMPLEMENTED THE EXACT SAME AMAZON CART UI SHOWN IN THE FRONTEND ASSESSMENT DOCUMENT TO DEMONSTRATE MY KNACK FOR PIXEL-PERFECT UI IMPLEMENTATIONS EVEN WHEN THE UI IS AN ORDINARY JPG IMAGE AND NOT A PROPER INSPECTABLE FIGMA/SKETCH/... FILE ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
- I AVOIDED USE OF 'CHIMONEY' FOR REPOSITORY NAMING TO AVOID GETTING PLAGIARIZED (Notice 'cm-checkout')
- Live link: https://chimoney-cart-checkout.netlify.app ðŸš¨
- PS: IF I HAD MORE TIME, I'D HAVE DONE E2E TESTS WITH CYPRESS, USED PROPER SKELETON LOADERS AND EXTENDED THE UI FURTHER TO CAPTURE A FULL AMAZON-LIKE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE.
- FOR SOME REASON, THE CHIMONEY API WASN'T RETURNING GIFT-CARDS, HENCE, I HAD TO USE DUMMY DATA AND YET DEMONSTRATE MY API FETCHING SKILLS BY FETCHING THE 3 IMAGE FILES IN THE featuredProducts ARRAY OF THE CHIMONEY /assets API.

## Technologies

- React JS
- Create React App
